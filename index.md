### Stephen Wright
I am the Department Chair for [Computer Science](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). My research interests are in computational optimization and its applications to many areas of science and engineering. Prior to joining UW-Madison in 2001, I was a senior computer scientist at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/) (1990-2001) and a professor of computer science at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/en) (2000-2001). From 2007 to 2010, I served as chair of the [Mathematical Optimization Society](https://www.mathopt.org/). I was a member of the Board of Trustees of the [Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics](https://www.siam.org/) (SIAM) from 2005-2014.

I am the author or coauthor of widely used text/reference books in optimization, including “[Primal Dual Interior-Point Methods](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611971453)” (SIAM, 1997) and “[Numerical Optimization](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-40065-5)” (2nd Edition, Springer, 2006, with J. Nocedal). I have published widely on optimization theory, algorithms, software and applications. I am also the coauthor of widely used software for linear and quadratic programming and compressed sensing. I have been editor-in-chief of the SIAM Journal on Optimization (2014-2019) and Mathematical Programming, Series B (2003-2007) and have served in editorial positions in numerous other  journals in optimization  and applied mathematics.
