### Stephen Wright
I am currently the Department Chair for [Computer Science](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). My research interests focuses on computational optimization and its applications to many areas of science and engineering. Prior to joining UW-Madison in 2001, I was a senior computer scientist at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/) (1990-2001) and a professor of computer science at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/en) (2000-2001). From 2007 to 2010, I served as chair of the [Mathematical Optimization Society](https://www.mathopt.org/), and currently on the board of the [Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics](https://www.siam.org/)(SIAM).

I am the author or coauthor of widely used text/reference books in optimization, including “[Primal Dual Interior-Point Methods](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611971453)” (SIAM, 1997) and “[Numerical Optimization](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-40065-5)” (2nd Edition, Springer, 2006, with J. Nocedal). I have published widely on optimization theory, algorithms, software and applications. I am also the coauthor of widely used software for linear and quadratic programming and for compressed sensing. I currently serve on the editorial boards of the leading journals in optimization (SIAM Journal on Optimization and Mathematical Programming, Series A) as well as SIAM Review and Advances in Computational Mathematics. I previously served a term as editor-in-chief of Mathematical Programming, Series B.
