- Design and analysis of algorithms for continuous  optimization.
- Optimization in machine learning and other areas.

### Software

- Optimization software: [PCx](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~swright/PCx/) (linear programming), [OOQP](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/%7Eswright/ooqp/) (convex quadratic programming).
- Compressed sensing software: [GPSR](http://www.lx.it.pt/%7Emtf/GPSR/), [SpaRSA](http://www.lx.it.pt/%7Emtf/SpaRSA/). Also [GPU codes for signal and image processing](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/%7Eswright/GPUreconstruction/), and [TV denoising software](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/%7Eswright/TVdenoising/), and the [LPS](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~swright/LPS) code for regularized logistic regression.
